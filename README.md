# Fully convolutional network for image segmentation

This is a model implemented as part of my master thesis. The goal is that the model should segment multispectral images, so that building information can be extracted.

## Tensorflow
The network is implemented by using the library TensorFlow.

## Recognition
The network is based on the SegNet implementation by tkuanlan35: https://github.com/tkuanlun350/Tensorflow-SegNet.
